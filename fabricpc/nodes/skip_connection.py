"""
Skip connection node for residual architectures.

SkipConnection sums inputs from two slots and passes the sum through:

  - "in"   (``is_variance_scalable=True``): receives computed branch
    contributions. The node is weightless (fan_in=1), so muPC scales each
    edge by ``gain/sqrt(K_slot * L)`` — the once-per-branch depth damping,
    applied where the branch joins the residual stream.
  - "skip" (``is_skip_connection=True``): receives the residual stream.
    Edges pass through at scale 1.0, preserving the identity mapping that
    carries signal through deep networks. Connecting this slot makes the
    node a merge node and counts it toward the residual depth L.

This is LinearResidual's slot layout without the weights. Use
SkipConnection to merge a computed branch into the residual stream. Use
IdentityNode for summation points where all inputs are independent and
should be variance-scaled without depth damping.

Example — a residual block in graph form::

    linear = Linear(shape=(128,), name="h1")
    skip   = SkipConnection(shape=(128,), name="res1")

    edges = [
        Edge(source=prev, target=linear.slot("in")),    # branch (transform)
        Edge(source=prev, target=skip.slot("skip")),    # stream (unscaled)
        Edge(source=linear, target=skip.slot("in")),    # branch joins stream
    ]
