"""
Error-parameterized predictive coding (ePC) inference.

State-based PC (sPC — ``InferenceSGD`` and variants) relaxes the latents
z_latent by local gradient descent, so the output-loss signal attenuates by
the inference rate per layer per step and deep graphs need many steps. ePC
(Goemaere et al., arXiv 2505.20137) reparameterizes the same energy over the
prediction errors: the error ε is the first-class relaxed variable and each
z_latent is derived by a forward pass in schedule order,
``z_latent := z_mu + ε``. Because every node's z_mu depends on all upstream
latents, one ``jax.value_and_grad`` over the ε pytree through the whole
derived forward delivers the loss signal to every layer unattenuated. The
ε ↔ z_latent map is a bijection with unit-determinant triangular Jacobian
(paper Appendix C): identical energies, identical equilibria, and the final
derived state feeds the existing local weight-gradient path unchanged.

muPC note: ``scale_inputs`` applies inside the differentiated forward
exactly where the sPC loop applies it, and the global reverse pass supplies
the chain-rule factors automatically. The per-hop gradient preconditioners
(the ``jacobian_gain`` factor inside ``topdown_grad_scale``, and
``self_grad_scale``) condition sPC's one-hop updates and are not replicated
here — a global backward pass has no per-hop damping to compensate.
``scale_weight_grads`` at learning time is untouched.

Memory: each step's single ``value_and_grad`` stores activations for the
whole derived forward — full depth times the unroll degree — reverse-mode
memory at backprop scale, versus sPC's per-node closures.

            with eigenvalue λ, so the output layer's weight gradient has the
            wrong sign along the top mode when (1 − ηλ_max)^T < −1/(λ_max − 1)
            (T = 1: η(λ_max − 1) > 1). Possible only at odd T, since
            (1 − ηλ)^T ≥ 0 at even T; the hidden errors keep their sign for
            every ηλ < 2.

        negative_weight: fraction of ‖g0‖² on negative-curvature modes.
        growth_min: (1 + η·max(0, −λ_min))^T, the growth of the most negative

    then ``growth_min > 1.1`` (indefinite), then the band with f̄, f_max, and

    toward, so the band never reads them; ``growth_min`` does.

    ePC inference: relax the prediction errors, derive the latents.

    Args:
        eta_infer: Inference rate on ε (default: 1e-3). The ε gradient is
            taken through the full network's transfer function — a change in
            one node's ε moves every downstream derived latent — so tune it
            like a weight learning rate, not like sPC's local per-node rate.
            Gradient descent on the error-coordinate energy is stable only
            for eta_infer < 2/λ_max(H_ε), the top excited eigenvalue of that
            energy's Hessian; ``fabricpc.core.epsilon_spectrum.epsilon_spectrum``
            measures it on any graph, and ``regime`` reads the verdict.
        infer_steps: Number of inference iterations (default: 5). One
            reverse pass per step reaches every layer, so a few steps replace
            sPC's hundreds on deep DAGs.
        latent_decay: Decay factor on ε in the update (default: 0.0).

    Backprop regime. One step from ε = 0 leaves ε_t = −eta_infer·∂L/∂z_t
    exactly, the backprop activation gradient at the feedforward point. The
    local weight gradients are then taken at the re-derived latents
    (``finalize_state``), so they match backprop's to first order in
    eta_infer·λ_max(H_ε): hidden layers scaled by eta_infer, the output
    layer unscaled (Goemaere et al., Theorem C.9, Case 1). The remainder
    comes from a node's input latent being re-derived at the perturbed
    upstream state, so a layer fed only by clamped nodes matches exactly.
    After T steps each excited error mode with Hessian eigenvalue λ has
    relaxed toward equilibrium by f(λ) = 1 − (1 − eta_infer·λ)^T. The
    regime is read on the modes that carry the starting gradient, weighted
    by the fraction of ‖∇_ε E‖² each carries (f̄, ``Regime.f_weighted``):
    f̄ ≪ 0.1 is backprop-like (Case 2); f̄ > 0.9 is the PC equilibrium, which
    needs eta_infer·T·λ ≳ 3 on those modes, and on a linear graph they are
    the eig(S) modes of Innocenti et al.'s Theorem 1 (S = I + JJᵀ, J the map
    from the hidden errors to the output prediction), so the slowest of them
    sets T. eta_infer·λ_max < 2 is required for stability at every T. At odd
    T the output layer is damaged earlier: its weight gradient is
    proportional to the output residual after T steps, which along the top
    mode is (1 − eta_infer(λ_max − 1))·r at T = 1 and reverses sign once
    eta_infer·(λ_max − 1) > 1, while the hidden errors keep their sign for
    every eta_infer·λ < 2 (``Regime.output_gradient_reverses``).

    Optimizer. Under Adam the eta_infer scaling of the hidden-layer gradients
    is normalized away while eta_infer·|g| ≫ Adam's ε (1e-8), so 1-step ePC
    with Adam trains as backprop with Adam; below that the ε term damps the
    hidden layers. Without Adam the hidden layers learn eta_infer times
    slower than the output layer, a 1000× disparity at the default.

    Weight scale. On a chain λ_max = 1 + σ_max(J)² grows with the product of
    the downstream weights' actions, so it grows during training and a fixed
    eta_infer can cross 2/λ_max late in a run. The defaults have no regime meaning independent
    of the graph, so set both arguments explicitly and read ``regime``.
    ``fabricpc.training.RegimeProbe`` tracks the spectrum and the regime
    during any ``train`` run; ``docs/user_guides/17_training_with_epc.md``
    gives the workflow.
